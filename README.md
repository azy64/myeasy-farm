# <img src='./public/2-logo.png' width="120" alt="logo"/> MyEasy Farm Test 

This project is about making a small map web application with the following requirements:
- An app should have a welcome screen with a start button at the very center of the page;
- After clicking on the start you should be presented with the map, where fields (from partfield.json) are displayed;
- You should be able to click on the field and see a list of available maps for this field;
- You should be able to click on a map to preview it;
- During preview app should focus (zoom/center) on the map you are previewing;
- You should be able to exit the preview screen by clicking on the close button;
- Maps should either use predefined colors or be colorized based on the value;
- On the top left corner the logo should always be visible.


 ## Input:
- 2 files with responses from the server (a subset of fields and a subset of soil maps);
- logo and colors guidance;
- UX sketch;
- reference screenshots from the real app, showing some of the maps and fields.
